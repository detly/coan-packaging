Description: tool for analysing preprocessor directives in C/C++ files
 Coan is a software engineering tool for analysing preprocessor-based
 configurations of C or C++ source code. Its principal use is to simplify a body
 of source code by eliminating any parts that are redundant with respect to a
 specified configuration. Dead code removal is an application of this sort.
